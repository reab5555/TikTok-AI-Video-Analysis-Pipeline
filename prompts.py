Consider the following guidelines:
- The more exposed the body (male or female), the higher the rating.
- Revealing clothing (e.g., swimsuits, underwear) increases the rating.
- Any sexually suggestive behavior or content increases the rating.
- The rating applies equally to male and female body exposure.
