text1 = """Something is unexpected or surprising if it is inconsistent with our background beliefs or violate our expectations.

Consider the following guidelines:
- A thing we usually expect to happen given X, but something else happen instead that surprise us and violate our expectation.
- A video or a scene begin with X, and change or end surprisingly or unexpectedly with Y.
- Several surprising or unexpected things can happen during the video, but we must only focus on the most surprising or unexpected.
- Something that is unusual for a typical situation or behaviour, and that violate our expectation.
- The way someone behave that is unusual or violate our expectations in terms of their social role or stereotype.
- A social convention that is violated and not expected, or when we encounter behaviour that violates these established roles.
- The context in which the things happen.
- The desirability or undesirability of the surprising unexpected event, element, object, or behaviour, or of the event, element, object or behaviour we expect, but is violated.
- The facial expressions and emotional states of the peoples who appear in the video, and their unexpected changes.
- The emotional valence changes in the video, for example, from Positive to Negative, from Negative to Positive, from Negative to more Negative, from Positive to more Positive, from Neutral to Positive, from Neutral to Negative.

Rate from a scale of 1 to 5 how much the video is surprising or violate our expectations or beliefs.
- Take into consideration the confidence in the expectation, and the probability of it to happen. The higher the confidence in what we expect, and the more this expectation is violated, the higher the rating.
- Some videos will not have something surprising at all, without any clear expectation to something specific.

Here are the levels of surprise:
    1 - Not surprising at all
    2 - Slightly surprising
    3 - Moderately surprising
    4 - Very surprising
    5 - Extremely surprising

- The more exposed the body (male or female), the higher the rating.
- Revealing clothing (e.g., swimsuits, underwear) increases the rating.
